## My Repositories

- [`Tetris`](https://github.com/AukeB/Tetris) and [`boom-tetris`](https://github.com/AukeB/boom-tetris): 🎮 A Python implementation of the most classic version of Tetris for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), with some fun additions such as commentary mode. I am working on refactoring the Tetris repository into the boom-tetris repository.

- [`algorithms-from-scratch`](https://github.com/AukeB/algorithms-from-scratch): 🧠 Contains implementations of algorithms without using any ML, AI or other packages that do the job for you.

- [`pdf-chef`](https://github.com/AukeB/pdf-chef): 🧾 Code for converting .json files into good looking PDF documents, based on a predefined PDF structure.

- [`score-snatcher`](https://github.com/AukeB/score-snatcher): 🎼 Repository for turning YouTube videos of musical scores into PDF documents.

- [`photo-merger`](https://github.com/AukeB/photo-merger): 📸 Merge photos from multiple directories chronologically into a single directory by extracting metadata.

- ['tree-scaper'](https://github.com/AukeB/tree-scaper): 🌲 Repository for visualizing tree and forest structures with hierarchical nodes and branches, featuring dynamic layouts, using Python and PyGame.

- [`notebooks`](https://github.com/AukeB/notebooks): 📓 All kinds of different notebooks, see below for an overview.

- [`university-courses-and-research`](https://github.com/AukeB/university-courses-and-research): 🎓 Contains all the code I wrote for my University courses and research projects.

- [`template-repo`](https://github.com/AukeB/template-repo): 🏗️ Template repository that can be used for starting other repositories.

  <summary><strong>🧠 Algorithms from Scratch</strong></summary>

- `GPT Tokenizer`: Implementation of a tokenizer similar to the GPT model, which converts text into smaller units for processing by language models.

- `Nearest Neighbours`: Simple algorithm to find the closest points in a dataset, commonly used in classification and recommendation systems.

- `2D Water Ripple Simulation`: Simulates ripples on a water surface in two dimensions, demonstrating wave propagation and interference patterns.

- `Diamond-Square Algorithm`: Procedural generation algorithm for creating realistic 2D terrain heightmaps.

- `Wave Function Collapse Algorithm`: Constraint-based algorithm for generating patterns and structures while respecting local adjacency rules, often used in procedural content generation.

  <summary><strong>📘 Notebooks</strong></summary>

- `advent_of_code/advent_of_code_2025.py`: 🎄 Contains my solutions for all Advent of Code 2025 puzzles. The same folder also contains solution to earlier AoC problems I have solved.

- `book_language_translation.ipynb`: 🌍 Processes an .epub file in another language (for example, German), detects all the different words in the vocabulary, categorize words linguistically, and translates each noun into another language (for example, Dutch).

- `image_to_text.ipynb`: 🖼️ Automates OCR extraction from image files, saves the recognized text to a .txt file, and optionally converts the results into a PDF document.

- `speech_to_text.ipynb`: 🎙️ Downloads audio from YouTube, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper, merges the transcript with timestamps, and splits the result into manageable text chunks for further processing.
